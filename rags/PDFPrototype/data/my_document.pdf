The Llama is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the Pre-Columbian era.
Llamas are very social animals and live with other llamas as a herd.
Their wool is soft and lanolin-free. Llamas can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions.
When used as pack animals, they can carry about 25 to 30% of their body weight for 8 to 13 km (5–8 miles).
